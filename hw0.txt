# Description of your program (part 7)
	Create a word counter that tracks the total number of words. 
	Use a scanner to look at every singular character in the file. 
	If the character is a space or a number, ignore the item and 
	move to the next. If the item is a letter, continue on to the 
	next object until it is no longer a letter. The word count then
	increases by one. Continue until there is nothing left in the
	document. 


# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
	I didn't personally enjoy the ambiguity of this assignment because
	it makes the language and phrasing difficult to consider. Overall, 
	the concept of the program seemed fairly simple, however I am basing
	that off of my experience in CSE 142 (which is my only experience)
	and thus I really have no idea what I'm doing!!
